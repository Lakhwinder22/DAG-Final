                                This pandemic period rushes India’s economy as well as the education system. As the Indian education system is one of the largest education systems in the world that is why it was coerced to slam its brakes and come to stop putting at risk the learning for more than 280 million students of this country. But for this pandemic, there is an almost 18 months gap and many people lose their jobs and more than 60% of people facing the problem of MSME pose a serious risk to our demographic dividend. So a poor economy forces a person to reconsider their investment into education and use the extra hands at home to work. So “learning loss” occurs. It causes fatal changes in the economy. Withdrawal of a lot of students can be a reason driven by private educators which causes another economic crisis.

Direct Admission allow you to self-learn and learn through the online mode. It can help you with your education and you do not have to go out. We can provide you with the best online education in terms of teaching and learning hours.

                                There are 91% of Indian students who want to go abroad and take higher studies. Studying in the UK is one of the dreams of a lot of students. Before the pandemic, they want to go to nations such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. But now for this covid-19 they change their thinking and choose New Zealand, Germany, and even Ireland for foreign study.
